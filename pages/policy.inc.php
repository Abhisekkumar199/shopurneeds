                            <p>As a reputable and trusted business committed to offering its customers high quality products, we recognise our obligation to ensure that all Partners and other suppliers are operating ethically. We expect all Partners and other suppliers to consistently provide an environment which protects their employees' health and safety and basic human rights. All Partners and other suppliers are expected to comply with their national employment laws and regulations with particular regard to: minimum age of employment, freely chosen employment, health and safety, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, no discrimination, no harsh or inhumane treatment, working hours, rates of pay and terms of employment. We will never knowingly allow a Partner to offer its products on the Website if such products are sourced from countries which are in breach of these principles. We also look to the Partners and other suppliers to instil these principles when dealing with their own supplier base. Because of the sometimes complex nature of the Partners and other suppliers' supply chain, it is not always possible to monitor and control the conditions of each individual involved in the production of the products. However, as we continue to grow, we recognise the importance of being proactive and doing everything within our power to support the rights of those involved in the manufacture of the products.</p>

                            <p>The shopurneeds Retail Pvt. Ltd. Kidswear product safety policy sets out guidelines to highlight the types of products that Partners might be restricted to sell via the shopurneeds Retail Pvt.

Our policy states that Partners should seek regular independent advice and assurances from the brand/manufacturer/importer from whom the product is purchased to determine whether the goods are permitted to be sold into the country and where applicable, the state, in which the buyer is located. While we work closely with our Partners, it is our Partner’s responsibility to ensure that the goods they sell comply with all applicable product laws and regulations, such as Flammability Standards, Certificates of Compliance and Tracking Labels. Our Customer Service Advisors can liaise with the relevant Partner if you require additional information.</p>
